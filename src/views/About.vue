          <p class="text-black font-semibold text-md">At Casual Stiches, we have tailored our livelihoods on Altering and Tailoring people’s clothing into works of art.

            There is a big difference between a seamstress or tailor who can simply perform an alteration for you and an experienced, skilled, and professionally trained seamstress or tailor who can guide you on proper garment fit.

We promise, and behind that promise, we want you to know that we back our work with a satisfaction guarantee. We won’t stop working until you like what we’ve done.Tailoring & custom alterations for different body types is our forte. I believe that good tailors can enhance the fit by making subtle changes to customer measurements after comparing the weight, height, and body dimensions of the individual with the measurements provided to them. Suggestion on improvements on how to measure yourself to getting that custom look while making the process easy is provided by our tailors. We are experienced & will provide clients with a variety of modern designs.
